### 2.Tidy data

Apply gather() to bmi and save the result as bmi_long, This will create two new columns:
<br>year, containing as values what are currently column headers.
<br>bmi_val, the actual BMI values

```
bmi_long <- gather(bmi, year, bmi_val, -Country)
```
Run the code given to arrange() the rows of census2 by the YEAR column.
```
census2_arr <- arrange(census2, YEAR)
```
Use spread() to reverse the operation that you performed in the last exercise with gather(). In other words, 
make bmi_long wide again.
```
bmi_wide <- spread(bmi_long, year, bmi_val)
```
Apply the separate() function to bmi_cc
<br>Separate Country_ISO into two columns: Country and ISO
<br>Be sure to specify the correct separator with the sep argument
<br>Save the result to a new object called bmi_cc_clean
```
bmi_cc_clean <- separate(bmi_cc, col = "Country_ISO", into = c("Country", "ISO"), sep = "/")

```
Apply the unite() function to bmi_cc_clean
<br>Reunite the Country and ISO columns into a single column called Country_ISO
<br>Separate each country name and code with a dash (-)
<br>Save the result as bmi_cc
```
bmi_cc <- unite(bmi_cc_clean,  Country_ISO,  c("Country", "ISO"),sep = "-")
```
Rearrange columns using dplyr's select()
```
weather5 <- select(weather4, date, Events, CloudCover:WindDirDegrees)
```

View the first 20 rows of the result
```
head(bmi_long,20)
```

### 3. Preparing data for analysis
Make this evaluate to "character"
```
class("TRUE")
```
Make this evaluate to "numeric"
```
class(8484.00)
```
Make this evaluate to "integer"
```
class(99L)
```
Make this evaluate to "factor"
```
class(factor("factor"))
```
Make this evaluate to "logical"
```
class(FALSE)
```
Coerce Grades to character
```
students$Grades <- as.character(students$Grades)
```
See what happens if we try to convert PrecipitationIn to numeric
```
as.numeric(weather5$PrecipitationIn)
```
Coerce Medu to factor
```
students$Medu <- as.factor(students$Medu)
```
Load the lubridate package
```
library(lubridate)
```

Print "17 Sep 2015" as a date.
```
dmy("17 Sep 2015")
```

Print "July 15, 2012 12:56" as a date and time (note there are hours and minutes, but no seconds!).
```
mdy_hm("July 15, 2012 12:56")
```

Coerce dob to a date (with no time)
```
students2$dob <- ymd(students2$dob)
```

Coerce nurse_visit to a date and time
```
students2$nurse_visit <- ymd_hms(students2$nurse_visit)
```
Load the stringr package
```
library(stringr)
```

Trim all leading and trailing whitespace
```
str_trim(c("   Filip ", "Nick  ", " Jonathan"))
```
Pad these strings with leading zeros
```
str_pad(c("23485W", "8823453Q", "994Z"), width = 9, side = "left", pad = "0")
```
Make states all uppercase and save result to states_upper
```
states_upper < toupper(states)
```

Make states_upper all lowercase again
```
tolower(states_upper)
```
Detect all dates of birth (dob) in 1997 using str_detect(). This should return a vector of TRUE and FALSE values.
```
str_detect(students3$dob, "1997")
```
Replace all instances of "F" with "Female" in students3$sex.
```
students3$sex <- str_replace(students3$sex, "F", "Female")
```
Call is.na() on social_df to spot all NA values.
```
is.na(social_df)
```

Use the any() function to ask whether there are any NAs in the data
```
any(is.na(social_df))
```
Count missing values
```
sum(is.na(weather6))
```
Find missing values
```
summary(weather6)
```
Find indices of NAs in Max.Gust.SpeedMPH
```
ind <- which(is.na(weather6$Max.Gust.SpeedMPH))
```
Look at the full rows for records missing Max.Gust.SpeedMPH
```
weather6[ind, ]
```
Call table() on the status column
```
table(social_df$status)
```

Replace all empty strings in status with NA
```
social_df$status[social_df$status == ""] <- NA
```
Print social_df to the console
```
social_df
```
Use complete.cases() to see which rows have no missing values
```
complete.cases(social_df)
```

Use na.omit() to remove all rows with any missing values
```
na.omit(social_df)
```
View a histogram of absences, but force zeros to be bucketed to the right of zero
```
hist(students3$absences,right = FALSE)
```
View a boxplot of age
```
boxplot(students3$age)
```
